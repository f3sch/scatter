There is no real improvement visible using cache_aligned allocators.
They probably already aligned anyways.

* Notes
- the data is now cache aligned
- there are benchmarks for local data
- serialSimd crashed without avx512 instructions
- serialUnrolledLoop throws with wrong results
- for both the core crashes are included
- I canceled the *ScanBench as they are ridiculously slow
